 - How to run unit tests:
    use command "make unittest" - this will compile and run unittests 1-4 and
    cardtests 1-4, run gcov on dominion.c for each test, and print the test
    output and gcov results (-f selected to show function coverage) to the file
    unittestresults.out

 - How to clean directory:
    use command "make clean" - this will remove all files created during any
    make rule from the Makefile.
